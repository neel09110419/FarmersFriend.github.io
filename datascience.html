        Agritech trends: Use of data science in agriculture
    </h1>

    <h1>Data has a better Idea</h1>
    <p>
        The time is ripe for the Indian agricultural sector to adopt best practices by using data science, deploy smart farming techniques and build integrated supply chains to boost productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data science is the method of gleaning insights from data. It enables the use of real-time data and past data to form meaningful insights on buyer behaviour, customer credit behaviour, product testing, cropping patterns, and others.
<br>
Data science already plays a significant role in banking and healthcare, both in India and globally. The principles of data science could also be applied to the Indian agriculture industry across the value chain from the farm through retail.

    <h3>Data science can provide actionable insights bespoke to farmers’ land and ownership pattern on what to plant, when to plant, and what farm practices to deploy. Making well-informed decisions could save costs and enhance a farmer’s profitability and income.
</h3><br>
       <h2> Enabling smart farming</h2>
<p>
Solutions to enable real-time monitoring of farms will help farmers deploy corrective measures on time. For example, early disease detection in crops and monitoring soil moisture levels in farms for optimised yield.
<br>
Smart farming helps farmers monitor relevant parameters continuously through IoT-enabled solutions. These solutions may also help farmers automate and optimise processes such as pesticide spraying, irrigating, rejuvenation of soil, and other such activities.
</p>
<h2>Financial solutions for farmers</h2>
<p>
Banks and other financial institutions do not have adequate data on crop performance and farmer incomes. Data science solutions on farmlands and cultivation trends can help financial services companies to improve their underwriting of loans and insurance products for agri-related financing.
</p>

<h2>Building integrated supply chains</h2>
<p>
COVID-19 has emphasised the need to build integrated supply chains. Crisis or not, you still need food on the table. Data-led and tech-enabled processes enhance procurement capabilities, farm-level traceability, and tracking, thereby ensuring a smoother supply chain and helping reduce food wastage.
