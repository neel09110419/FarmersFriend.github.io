         It grows as tall as 10 ft in height. Some of the natural strains can also attain a height of 43 ft. The stem is very thick and rounded. The roots are fibrous, running deep into the soil. The leaves are long and linear. Both male and female flowers grow on different parts of the plant. Male flowers develop at the top end of the stem in a cluster while the female flowers are borne inside the cobs. The corn grains are rounded, disc-like and range in colors from creamy white, yellow, orange to even red and purple. The corn varieties differ in crop duration, height, shape and color of the seed, composition and even its usage.

        <b> Climate for Maize Cultivation:</b> Maize cannot tolerate frost and hence it is a Kharif crop sown just before the monsoons arrive in India. It requires about 70 mm of rainfall. Alternate spells of sunshine and rainfall is optimal for maize production. It can tolerate temperature up to 35⁰C.
        </p>
        <p><b>Season for Maize Production:</b> Since maize requires a good amount of rainfall followed by a healthy spell of sunshine, it is a kharif crop. Sowing is done generally during June and July months. However, it is also sown during the months of January- February and September – October. In case of seed production, the seed maturity period must not coincide with the monsoons. Hence farmers sow during the November and December months for seed production.

        <b> Soil for Maize Production in India:</b> A soil with pH of 5.5 to 7.0 and a good drainage capacity is preferred for maize cultivation. Loamy sand, black soil and even clayey loam is suitable for maize. Both red soil and alluvial are said to be optimal for growing maize. However, it requires a good amount of organic matter even in a super-fertile soil. In case of black soil of the clayey variety, it is advisable to mix a considerable amount of sand so as to increase the drainage capacity of the soil. Soils that hold water is not preferred for maize cultivation.
