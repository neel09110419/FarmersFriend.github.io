        <p><b>Top Pulses Producing States:</b> Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Maharashtra , Uttar Pradesh , Karnataka.</p>
       <p> India is the largest producer as well as the consumer of pulses in the world.</p>
        <p>These are the major source of protein in a vegetarian diet.</p>
       <p> Major pulses grown in India are tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and gram.</p>
       <p> Being leguminous crops, all these crops except arhar help in restoring soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air. Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation with other crops.</p>
        <p>National Food Security Mission for Pulses, Pulses Development Scheme and Technological Mission on Pulses are few of the government’s plans to support pulses production.</p>
