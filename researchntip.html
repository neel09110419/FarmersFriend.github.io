<h3>Black/Regur Soil- </h3>Formed via the rocks of cretaceous lava, the black soil is found densely in Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan. Being rich in iron and other minerals its best for cultivating- cotton, linseed, tobacco, castor, and citrus fruits.

<h3>Alkaline/Saline Soil-</h3> Generally found in regions of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, and Maharashtra. This soil is unfit for cultivation due to too much saltiness in it.
<h3>Red Soil- </h3>A deeply red-orangish soil that's evident from many regions of North to South and East to West. Enriched with several minerals it's best for farming- pulses, millets, tobacco, cotton, wheat, oilseeds, potato, and orchards.
<h3>Desert Soil-</h3> Deposited on land by the direction of winds, this soil is found in states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana. This soil is best for less water-consuming agricultural practices like- Guar, Fodder, Bajra, and pulses(Dal).

<h1>4- Plan Smartly</h1>
<p>
Having a full-fledged plan with execution and exit strategy in case of emergencies is always a smart move for any business. How to do this/that? Business goal/objective for the coming future, market conditions, competition products, strengths, and weaknesses, pros, or cons must be jotted down beforehand.
<br>
This method is also known as <a href="http://www.luresext.edu/?q=content/how-do-swot-analysis#:~:text=The%20SWOT%20analysis%20helps%20to,success%20(Weaknesses%20or%20Threats).">SWOT Analysis</a>. May it be agriculture or farming, having a swift business plan saves time and money.

<h1>5- Invest In Best Farming Equipments</h1>
<p>
Any farming business is incomplete without the correct agricultural machinery. You do not have to buy along with the first offer they come to you with. Scouting the market for better deals is always a smarter way to purchase.
<br>
Find out if you can avail of any discounts or are you missing out on any potential sellers in the process. The brands that specialise in farming equipment mass production in India are- Mahindra, Escorts Agri Machinery, HMT Limited, New Holland, John Deere India Pvt. Ltd, Sonalika, and Balwan Tractors to name a few.
</p>
<h1>6- Recognise Your Target Customers</h1>
<p>
As mentioned above, there are so many types of farming and agribusiness one can venture into. But your priority or niche should be defined beforehand during your planning. It doesn't matter if you want to get into meat and fish farming, raise cattle, grow organic vegetables, produce fresh or seasonal fruits, your research should be the key.
<br>
It's important to figure out all about your target consumers and sellers and be prepared for conditions- when everything's sold out when half the produce or crops have turned sour, and when none of the harvests has been sold. A sustainable customer acquiring plan never hurts anyone and it has to be done even before buying your first seed or fishpond.
</p>
<h1>7- Be Reasonable With Goals</h1>
<p>
When you are starting a business that requires you to begin mostly from scratch it's smarter to resonate. You cannot become a giant conglomerate or a mass producer cross country in three months. Farming and Agriculture is a dream that many have, but only a few dare to follow.
<br>
Your goal map or SWOT analysis should be filled with small-term goals, realistic approaches, and practical on-field applications for the best results. Agriculture and organic farming need upgrades and investments on an annual basis. From yielding to harvesting and selling some costs are pretty prominent, so before investing all your money on a single sector consider all the factors that'll require your funding.
</p>
<h1>8- Begin Small</h1>
<p>
Starting any business from scratch can be very overwhelming for a beginner in the agriculture department. Begin from the basics to ensure minimal loss and better outputs. Instead of putting all your financial funding into acres of the barren plots, rent or lease a single one to begin cultivation. This will give you the chance to experience your soil, growth capacity, and if the profit remains substantial throughout, go ahead and expand your business.
</p>
<h1>9- Money Management</h1>
<p>
Having track of your cash flow is a crucial process for any business. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers welfare provisions multiple facilities from paperless transactions to modern-day farming processes to make the job easier. Beginning from important chemicals, seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, fuel for equipment to utility bills, every element should be accounted for and maintained wisely.
</p>

<h1>10- Understand The Science</h1>
<p>
Research and training might be the latter step forward in agricultural implements. But one must keep in mind the science behind this process. You must learn about every method that has been prevalent for ages along with the technologies that are taking over in the 21st century.
<br>
Do not shy away from contacting nutritionists, marketing consultants, crop consultants, veterinarians, or a financial advisor as they know their fields better than a beginner any day. Other provisions in India include- Kisan call center, vernacular(regional) based contacts available on Google, Kisan connect, Kisan Yojana, Kisan credit card scheme, and also kisan health card.
</p>
<h1>11- Training & Research</h1>
<p>
A powerful element in agribusiness and rural development lies in impeccable knowledge and execution. Reading books of genres regarding farming, agriculture, poultry, dairy, science, biotechnology are some of the things to start for research purposes.
<br>
Training can be both online and offline. Being one to one with farmers and helping them with your physical skills might help you acquire a tip or two. There are many WhatsApp groups, online helpline numbers, direct market consultants, certified trainers, or fertiliser experts easily accessible that makes the work easier.
</p>
<h1>12- Make Your Fertilisers/Pesticides</h1>
<p>
Once you are clear on How to make the agriculture and organic farming model ready to go, you can easily discover or curate fertilisers and pesticides that'll suit your harvest better. As a potential farmer, you must know your soil, microorganisms, and ferns to help with its fertility.
<br>
The Indian Government has provisioned farmers with few pesticides namely- Panchgavya, Neemastram, Dasparini kashayam alongside other common ones like amino acids and Lactic acid bacteria. Curating your fertilisers and water testing helps you alleviate bad or ill practices in farming.
</p>
<h1>13- Reuse Your Seeds</h1>
<p>
Corporate or vendors apart from APMC markets have successfully manipulated and brainwashed farmers into believing that the same seeds couldn't be used more than once. This could affect your financial cash flow resulting in a cash crunch earlier into the business.
<br>
Good quality seed is yielding, receptive, and infection resistant. If the harvest is done with healthy fertilised soil, it develops its immunity and just becomes stronger with age. Visiting other farms or similar ones like your business might help you get insights and resources for a good dealer and distributor. One mustn't solely rely on organic seeds for farming.
</p>
<h1>14- Irrigate</h1>
<p>
Any sustainable agricultural practice requires a good level of irrigation at regular intervals. The modern way to begin it is the drip irrigation system. A tubular system with tiny pits in between can be placed near the base root of your harvest, hence, incorporating accuracy in the watering front.
<br>
This also helps you in saving water by not wasting oodles of extra amount or losing it all quickly due to the Indian heat. As it would be machine-controlled, the supervision becomes easier.
